# DataCo-Build-Project
Exploration of machine learning models to predict shipping times using a supply chain dataset from DataCo Global available on Kaggle.

Completed: EDA, building of several models (logistic regression, random forest classification, xgb classficiation, and a randomized cv search of a xgbclassification model). The corresponding medium article can be accessed here: https://medium.com/@andresmvidaurre/can-machine-learning-models-be-used-to-predict-and-improve-shipping-times-fc55f00a8dd7

To-Do: further analysis of specific features and more hyperparameter tuning.
